			<h3 id="part1">Decline</h3>
			<p>naked along the side of the house,
				8 a.m., spreading sesame seed oil
				over my body, Jesus, have I come
				to this?
				I once battled in dark alleys for a
				laugh.
				now I'm not laughing.
				I splash myself with oil and wonder,
				how many years do you want?
				how many days?
				my blood is soiled and a dark
				angel sits in my brain.
				things are made of something and
				go to nothing.
				I understand the fall of cities, of
				nations.
				a small plane passes overhead.
				I look upward as if it made sense to
				look upward.
				it's true, the sky has rotted:
				it won't be long for any of
				us.</p>

			<h3 id="part2">A Radio With Guts</h3>
			<p>it was on the 2nd floor on Coronado Street
				I used to get drunk
				and throw the radio through the window
				while it was playing, and, of course,
				it would break the glass in the window
				and the radio would sit there on the roof
				still playing
				and I'd tell my woman,
				"Ah, what a marvelous radio!"
				the next morning I'd take the window
				off the hinges
				and carry it down the street
				to the glass man
				who would put in another pane.
				I kept throwing that radio through the window
				each time I got drunk
				and it would sit there on the roof
				still playing-
				a magic radio
				a radio with guts,
				and each morning I'd take the window
				back to the glass man.
				I don't remember how it ended exactly
				though I do remember
				we finally moved out.
				there was a woman downstairs who worked in
				the garden in her bathing suit,
				she really dug with that trowel
				and she put her behind up in the air
				and I used to sit in the window
				and watch the sun shine all over that thing
				while the music played.</p>

		<div class="curtain">
			<h3 id="part3">Curtain</h3>
			<p>the final curtain on one of the longest running
				musicals ever, some people claim to have
				seen it over one hundred times.
				I saw it on the tv news, that final curtain:
				flowers, cheers, tears, a thunderous
				accolade.
				I have not seen this particular musical
				but I know if I had that I wouldn't have
				been able to bear it, it would have
				sickened me.
				trust me on this, the world and its
				peoples and its artful entertainment has
				done very little for me, only to me.
				still, let them enjoy one another, it will
				keep them from my door
				and for this, my own thunderous
				accolade.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="sparrow">
			<h3 id="part4">As The Sparrow</h3>
			<p>To give life you must take life,
				and as our grief falls flat and hollow
				upon the billion-blooded sea
				I pass upon serious inward-breaking shoals rimmed
				with white-legged, white-bellied rotting creatures
				lengthily dead and rioting against surrounding scenes.
				Dear child, I only did to you what the sparrow
				did to you; I am old when it is fashionable to be
				young; I cry when it is fashionable to laugh.
				I hated you when it would have taken less courage
				to love.</p>
